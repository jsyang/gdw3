# GameDev Weekend #3

Originally made for a game jam: http://jam.legendaryfisher.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=175 back in May 2013.
Written in Coffeescript, but has since been ported over to JS. Drew all the graphics and collected and modified
some public domain / royalty-free sounds. Working but unfinished due to the scope of the project.
